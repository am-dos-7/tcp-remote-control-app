## tcp-remote-control-app
This repo holds files relative to a TCP remote control app: the rempte control app's code in QML/C++, and a C++ sample code for a ESP32-driven small-scale car.  
This project was originally started as an end-of-year project in engineering school, and later on progressively refined as a personal project. Improvements are still going on ;)
